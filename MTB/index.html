							<strong>Hardtail</strong>
							<p>Hardtail bikes have a suspension at the front and a stiff pipe right under the bike seat. They are cheaper and are thus great beginners to start with. It is a great bike to start and to discover whether mountain biking is a sport you want to get into without breaking the bank.</p>

							<strong>Full Suspension</strong>
							<p>Full suspension bikes are best bikes currently available in the market. If you decide to really get into mountain biking, this is the bike you will want to have for all terrain biking and well as for use in any type of discipline you want to try or get into.</p>

						<strong>Hardtail Mountain Bikes</strong> are called as such because they have a solid vertical pipe under the seatpost. All mountain bikes come with a front suspension to dampen the impact at the front. The following are the advantages a hardtail has over a full suspension:
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Mechanically Simpler</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						With no pivots, rear shocks and additional mounts, a hardtail bike has a lot less to go wrong with it mechanically. Because there is a lot less fitted on the bike, it's easier to clean post-ride.
						This means that you have more time spent riding than cleaning, repair and maintenance on your bike.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Cheaper</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						At any price point, you will get better components and frame for your money with a hardtail because the manufacturer does not have to pay for the extra cost of a pivoting rear end and a rear shock.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Lighter</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						The rear shock system adds a lot of weight to the bike. Manufacturers try and compensate with better, lighter materials, but that just inflates the cost more. If having a light bike is important for you because for example, you want to be the first up the hill, then hardtails are the way to go.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Challenging but Fun</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						Riding the trails is a lot less comfortable on a hardtail because you do not have that rear suspension to dampen the terrain. You compensate for this by having your knees dampen it for you. It also takes skill to go through a terrain without a rear suspension so it gets you thinking how to better attack the trail and carefully select the line you will take to tackle a terrain. This gives you a better sense of achievement at the end of it.</p>

						<strong>Full Suspension Mountain Bikes</strong> have a suspension under the seatpost as well as a front suspension. These suspensions dampens the impact and vibration. Full suspension mountain bikes are usually used on rougher and technical trails. Of course, no one's stopping you from using it on mild terrain. To get the most out of a full suspension bike, the suspensions or shocks need to be set up properly. The following are the advantages a full suspension has over a hardtail:
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Comfort</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						With the shocks in the front and back absorbing a majority of the impact, you don't use up a lot of stamina and so you don't get tired as fast. Especially on long rides, you will not end up as tired at the end of the ride compared to using a hardtail. This also means you can push yourself to ride further.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Better Handling</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						With the shocks absorbing a lot of impact and vibrations, you will have more time to focus your attention on handling the bike and also a bit more leeway when riding on rough terrain. The suspensions also make the bike grip the terrain better(traction) making your ride less sketchy.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>Faster</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						The combination of traction and shock absorption makes full suspension bikes really fast as it just runs over the terrain without having the rider feel the roughness of the terrain being traveled on, especially on downhills. Though because of the shocks, it can be a hard going uphill especially without proper pedal technique. Though this is minimized by a rear-shock setting that makes it stiffer, there is still a little bit of play which makes you spend a bit more energy compared to a totally stiff hardtail.
						</p>
						<p>
						<strong>More Fun in Certain Ways</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
						If you like going over very rough terrain, specially ones with rocks as half the size of your head, as well drop over ledges at least half your height to as high as you are brave enough to drop on, then full suspension will make the most out of the activity without beating you up because the suspensions will take the beating for you.

				For safety, you will need equipment to keep you safe from harm. It is unavoidable to have some accidents due to unforseen circumstances or from your own actions such as miscalculations. The following are the basic equipment you will need for mountain biking as well as some optional ones.</p>

						<div class="gear_content_text">
							<p>
							<strong>Half-Lid Helmet</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							A helmet is the first and most important equipment you will need to protect your head. A half-lid helmet is sufficient for most riding situations. It can protect your head from the worst impacts. The only thing it cannot do is protect your face.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="gear_content">
						<img class="gear_content_img" src="img/fullface.jpg" />
						<div class="gear_content_text">
							<p>
							<strong>Full Face Helmet</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							A full face helmet will totally protect your head from any harm, given the impact is within the impact rating it can handle. But a full face is not always the helmet you will want to wear since it is quite heavy and can get really hot within the helmet.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="gear_content">
						<img class="gear_content_img" src="img/waterpack.jpg" />
						<div class="gear_content_text">
							<p>
							<strong>Waterpack</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							Always bring water when you are out riding. Water pack can either be in backpack types or bottle, it does not really matter, what matters is that you have water at all times. Having water will prevent you from overheating and dehydration.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="gear_content">
						<img class="gear_content_img" src="img/gloves.jpg" />
						<div class="gear_content_text">
							<p>
							<strong>OPTIONAL: Gloves</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							A glove will help you grip your handles better. It is not evident on ride start, but as time goes on and you start sweating, gripping the handles become slippery which can possibly cause your hands to slip and cause a crash. This is optional since most people don't even ride that long and hard. And most riders always take a break before getting to the point where the hands are sweating so much. One thing to note though is that a glove can also protect your hands from getting injured when you crash.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="gear_content">
						<img class="gear_content_img" src="img/pads.jpg" />
						<div class="gear_content_text">
							<p>
							<strong>OPTIONAL: Pads(for Knee and/or Elbows)</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							Knee and elbow pads are also optional but would be a great protection to have. Every rider has their own preference as well as common type of crash based on riding habits. If you are a person who is likely to injure an elbow, get elbow pads, same goes for your knees. Of course, nothing beats complete protection when you have both types of pads for the occassional crash to protect your skin and bones.
